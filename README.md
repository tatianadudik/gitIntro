<h2>How do I like the course about Git?</h2>
<hr>
Well, it was really detailed and it's great. Each student should understand every bit of information told there, however, sometimes I tend to forget what have been told in the previous lessons since I hear too much of unused information.

As much as you know I should've learnt a lot of useful information, e.g. making commits, merging branches and making pull requests etc. And I successfuly passed this course.

I see no reason writing a bunch of words and making screenshots here.
It was for my own good to learn that.
